    <p>During my first semester of freshman year, I was involved in <b>Innovative Design</b>, an on-campus creative agency focused on making Berkeley beautiful. I joined as a <b>Gold Team graphic designer</b> and worked alongside with <b>on-campus organizations</b> and <b>my other team members</b> to create <b>designs</b> that reflected the <b>agencies' values and missions</b>.</p>
    <p>These are the projects that I worked on:</p>

      <p>My first client with Innovative Design was <b>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) at Berkeley</b>. The officers at IEEE at Berkeley requested a <b>logo remake</b> that <b>correlated</b> with the <b>official IEEE logo</b> while incorporating elements that <b>represented Berkeley</b>.</p>
      <p>For my first draft, I created a graphic of the <b>Campanile</b>, the symbolic clocktower at the center of the UC Berkeley campus. The Campanile, shaped similarly to an arrow, replaced the up arrow in the middle of the official IEEE logo. I replicated the kite shape and the circular arrow in order to stay <b>consistent</b> with the original IEEE logo.</p>

      </div>
      <p>I worked together with <b>Victor Zhang</b>, another graphic designer on my team. The circular arrow that he designed was more clean and visually looked better and was preferred by the officers at IEEE at Berkeley. We collaborated to combine his arrow with my Campanile.</p>

      <p>Victor and I worked together to determine the best placement of text for the final design. IEEE at Berkeley ended up selecting the following arrangement as the final design:</p>

      <p>My second client with Innovative Design was <b>Second Impressions at Berkeley</b>. The officers at Second Impressions at Berkeley requested a <b>logo and cover photo design</b> for both <b>Second Impressions at Berkeley</b> and <b>Second Impressions at UCLA</b>. During my first meeting with a representative from Second Impressions at Berkeley, I learned that the organization was similar to Humans of New York but for international people on campus and off campus. The organization's mission is to portray <b>internationalism and impressions</b>.</p>
      <p>Because the organization's mission is to portray internationalism and impressions, I wanted to include these aspects in my logo and cover photo designs. I decided to incorporate a <b>book</b> to represent <b>storytelling</b> and a <b>globe</b> to represent <b>internationalism</b>. The <b>plane</b>, which points towards Berkeley, represents the <b>journey from a different country to the United States</b>. </p>

      <br></br>
      <p>The officers at Second Impressions at Berkeley liked my design for the cover photo, so I digitalized my design on <b>Adobe Illustrator</b>. I incorporated the <b>school colors</b> in order to make the Berkeley and the UCLA cover photos distinctive.</p>

      <br></br>
      <p>Second Impressions at Berkeley ended up selecting the bottom row of cover photos (Berkeley with yellow background and UCLA with light blue background). Second Impressions at Berkeley is currently using my design as their cover photo on their Facebook page.</p>
